This program if an original free tool designed and created to be useful to the free softwre community.

The purpose of the proyect is to deliver a micro Hypervisor of type I to be used / started by GRUB or
 by COREBOOT, and able to run free and non free OS's and provide under the hoods introspection, debug
 and other services to the development of free application and and / or system software.

Actually the proyect is intended to support the AMD64 Family 10 or newer, but its design enables the
 support of other architectures (such as IA64) in the future.

This proyect is original code created for me (jhacks <jhackher@gmail.com>) but inspirated in some
 techniques ,algorhitms and code fragments by other free GPL proyects such as (but not limited to)
 COREBOOT, SYSLINUX, GRUB, LINUX, KVM XEN and can include in its installation unmodified or forked
 bundles from other free GPL proyects such as (but not limited to) COREBOOT, SYSLINUX, GRUB, LINUX,
 XEN; I, as the author, sign under the nickname of jhacks (jhacks <jhackher@gmail.com>), with the
 provided GPG key, the GPL3 license text file (jhacks.LICENSE.txt), to make this a FREE proyect.

This is critical system software TO be used only by skilled SYSTEM PROGRAMERS, WHITHOUT ANY WARRANTY,
 AT THEIR OWN RISK of software, hardware, or information loss, or any negative consequences of system
 unstability, error or faillure to boot at all (when code is flashed in EPROM in some configurations);
 In any case IT IS UNDER YOUR OWN RESPONSABILITY THE USE YOU MAKE OF THIS SOFTWARE and its capabilities
 to freeze, introspection etc. applied to privative, or in any fashion legally limited software.

	Happy Hacking and free software 4ever.
