Here come the documentation of the ia64 system architecture dependent classes.

All architecture-dependent code must come only in this module (hlib) and under a distinctive
extension (.i64 for ia64 or .x64 for x86-64)

NOTE: The implementation of this architecture (ia64) is planned at a later stage of development. (after the amd64 one)
