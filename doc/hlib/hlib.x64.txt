Here come the documentation of the x86-64 system architecture dependent classes.

All architecture-dependent code must come only in this module (hlib) and under a distinctive
extension (.x64 for x86-64 or .i64 for ia64)

Under this component we implement all classes, interfaces and other c++ resources to resemble a exact binary implementation of processor system resources relevant to the transparent virtualization of the guest os.
