1.-	Introduction.

	The goal of this proyect is to build a micro-hypervisor able to run unmodified guest os's and serve as a fundamental tool for the system programer to debug, test etc. with the help of free tools that can be co-located in DOM_0 (HCPL) and inspect memory and registers, system tables; set triggers to trap every type of system events etc. of the virtualized system in DOM_U (GDK).
